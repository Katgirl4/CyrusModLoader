## Linux BepinEx Install Instructions

### Step 0: Download and run the install script
The install assist script will automatically download and install the latest **BepinEx** version to your game directory and extract it.

The install script takes one argument, the path to the folder where your game is stored. It might be something like `~/.steam/debian-installation/steampps/common/[TODOGAMENAMEHERE]`.

It's written in Python (but will also leverage system commands for unzipping files), so run it with Python. Probably something like this:
```
python3 installAssistLinux.py -d ~/.steam/PATH_TO_YOUR_GAME_DIRECTORY
```

### Step 1: Setup DLL overrides
todo steam overrides
```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%
```

### Configure proxy to run

### Step 2: First time run

### Step 3: Configuration
